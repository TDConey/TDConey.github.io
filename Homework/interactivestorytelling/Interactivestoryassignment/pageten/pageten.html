<h3>Sir Gawain of New Rapport</h3>

<p>
Dominic Quintin and his real vocation was that of the city historian, but at this Sir 

Gawain was astonished at this claim! He gently patted Eric on the shoulder and told him 

that he must have been placed under some kind of spell by one of those mischievous 

enchanters! For the man stood before him was no mere historian but a knight of the 

realm! Eric put his head in his hands and shook his head slowly from side to side, as he 

knew that this was going to be a very long day indeed!
