<h3>Sir Gawain of New Rapport</h3>

<p>
had finally arrived at his destination, the city library! He walked into the building and 

directly into the office of the city historian where he found Dominic Quintin fast asleep 

on the couch. Carefully he pulled a chair over to the couch and grabbed hold of one of 

Dominic's shoulders began to shake him gently trying to wake him. Slowly Dominic sat 

himself up on the couch and began to wipe the sleep from his eyes, as he glanced at Eric 

with a confused look on his face. As Dominic moved his head, Eric was alarmed to see a 

very large bruise that was along the side of his friends face., so he asked him how he was 

feeling. Dominic made a dismissive gesture with his hand saying that this is just a flesh 

wound and a true knight like himself could endure this and worse easily. Worried that his 

friend's injury wasn't the only injury he had sustained, Eric asked him his name only to 

have Dominic looked at him as if he were insane! He stood straight up and declared that 

he was none other than the famous Sir Gawain of New Rapport! Defender of the code of 

Chivalry, the weak, and true justice! Eric asked him how he know that he was a knight 

only to have Sir Gawain place his right hand over his chest and tell him because his heart 

told him that it is so! He thanked Eric for being such a gracious host for providing him 

shelter in his castle but he must get his valiant steed Rocinate ready to continue their 

quest. Sir Gawain asks Eric if he knows of a good blacksmith where he could get another 

helm to replace the one that he had lost in a battle a couple of days ago. Curiously Eric 

asks him what happened to his last helm, only to be told by Sir Gawain that he lost it in a 

battle against some brigands who had captured a fellow knight! Eric lifted something up 

with his left hand and gave it to Sir Gawain, as he then asks him if this belonged to him. 

Sir Gawain graciously takes the object from him and carefully looks it over to find that it 

is his lost helm! Eric tried to talk some sense into him and told him that his real name is
